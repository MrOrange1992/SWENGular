# SWENGular

This repository is part of the course 'SWENGS' of the Bachelor study 'Information Management' of University of Applied Sciences in Graz.

It is the Frontend for our 'SWENGular' project, using Angular 5.

The Backend can be found here: https://github.com/MrOrange1992/swengularsb .

Our goal was to create an API based webservice where User can discover and manage movies.

The backend uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) in conjunction with the Java wrapper [themoviedbapi](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/themoviedbapi) from Holger Brandl.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## First run

When using the IntelliJ IDE you have to:
* Check out from version control
* Create project from existing sources
* Terminal: `npm install`
* Terminal: `npm start`

Now start a browser of your choice and navigate to `http://localhost:xxxx/` using the port from the terminal output (default = 4200).

## Development server

Run `ng start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
